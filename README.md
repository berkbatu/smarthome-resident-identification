# Human Identification and Tracking in Smart Environments
A repo for my thesis stuff which is on human identification and tracking in smart environments.

## Dataset
WSU Smart Environment(Twor2009). This dataset represents sensor events collected in the WSU smart apartment testbed during the 2009-2010 academic year.  The apartment housed two residents, R1 and R2, at this time and they performed their normal daily activities.
